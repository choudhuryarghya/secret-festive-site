            Dear Maam 🫂,

Wishing you and your family a Diwali filled with profound peace, shimmering happiness, and abundant prosperity.

As the Deeps (lamps) are lit, illuminating the world, I am reminded of the light your guidance and unwavering support has brought into my own journey. Your mentorship has been a true blessing—you have not just supported me, but you’ve inspired me to strive for better in every possible way. For your generosity and belief in me, I am deeply grateful.

May this festival mark the beginning of a year of wonderful successes and fulfillment for you.

With sincere respect and warmest wishes,🌸
        </p>
