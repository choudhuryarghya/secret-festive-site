           Happy Diwali! I know things have been complicated lately ☺️, but I genuinely wish you nothing but the best. I really miss our friendship and seeing you around. Hope you have a wonderful celebration and that the lights bring you all the joy and peace you deserve in your new chapter. Take care.
