           Happy Diwali, 

As we celebrate the triumph of light over darkness, I want to thank you for being the brightest light in my life. You love me so deeply, and your endless support and tireless effort in every possible way make my world complete. You give your all, and I promise to always cherish you for it.

Wishing you a Diwali that is as beautiful, warm, and joyful as the love we share.
